    <h3 class="heading">When to Use the “Cynthia Tested” Button</h3>
    <p>Accessible Web design and testing requires a process that includes both programmatic and manual visual tests to ensure accessibility.</p>
    <p>With this in mind, we recommend the following suggested usage of the “Cynthia Tested” button:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Select the Guideline or Standard that you want to announce that you follow (Section 508 or WCAG 2)</li>
        <li>Run the Cynthia Tester against the page</li>
        <li>Pass all automated tests</li>
        <li>Then, before using the Cynthia tested button, validate all manual tests</li>
        <li>We also strongly recommend, but do not require, that you place an accessibility statement on your page regarding the level of accessibility you support.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>This button requires minimum support for Section 508 and WCAG 2.0. Once you have completed the process above, proudly use the Cynthia Tested button to indicate your accessibility efforts and commitment!</p>
