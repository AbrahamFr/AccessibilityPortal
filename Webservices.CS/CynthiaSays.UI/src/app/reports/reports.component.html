    <h1 id="page-title" class="heading">Reading Report Results</h1>

    <p>The Result Report displays the results of your scan. The top of the report will show the URL that was scanned. Underneath that, there will be a “Scan Completed” with date and time stamp that the scan was run. Based upon the checkpoint group selected on the scan submit form, you will see the “Group” that the page was scanned against (i.e. Section 508, WCAG A, WCAG AA or WCAG AAA).</p>
    <p>The main body of the report will show a table of results for each checkpoint rule in the group that was tested. The results will list each checkpoint rule, a definition of that rule and the underlying results.  Because this is an interactive report, as you navigate over the line items you will have the ability to expand the results table.</p>
    <img alt="Reviewing the Results" src="<%= Page.ResolveUrl("~/Content/images/reports/resultsTable.png") %>" class="report-img" />
    <p>As you expand the results table you will have the ability to drill down to the specific line and column of the Failure, Warning, and Visual Check within the body of the Result Report.</p>
